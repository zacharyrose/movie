# Task 1: View list of movies

The homepage of our app should display movies in a nice visual list, currently it just displays an ugly text list. Update the list to match the UI in the comp in this folder (view_list_comp.pdf).

**Note:** The data already exists in the redux store, the path to the movies list data is `state.main.movies`.


Acceptance Criteria:
  1. The view should be served from the default route `http://localhost:3000/`.
  2. Each movie displays it's poster image and name.
  3. The name is centered below the poster.
  4. The movies display in a grid.
  5. No need to include the navigation section or hover behavior.
