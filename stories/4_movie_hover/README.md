# Task 4: Hover a movie for more information

As a consumer, I would like to see additional information about a Movie when I hover over in the Movie list.

On the homepage movie list when the user hovers over a movie we should display a "mini details" box. The details box will have some movie details - release date, runtime, and rating (IMDB rating out of 10). Please see the comp for an example of the expected layout (view_list_comp.pdf).

The information should come from the OMDB API (see step 2 for more information).

Acceptance Criteria:
  1. On the homepage when the user hovers over a movie a mini-details box is displayed
  2. The mini-details box should display the release date, rating, & runtime
  3. When the user unhovers over the movie the details box is removed
