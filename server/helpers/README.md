# Movie Server Test - Setup Helpers

### Note: THIS FOLDER SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE CODE TEST!!!

This is a support folder for the movie server code test.  It provides the base database schemas and scripts for loading movie data.

The data extract can be found on Kaggle: [Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset).  The code test uses the `movies_metadata.csv` and `ratings_small.csv` files.

The base databases contain the schema of the database but do not include any data.  It is recommended that the database is backed up prior to running loading scripts.
